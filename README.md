## Proposal:
	I want to ceate an app that can store and keep track where you parked your car. 
	Its easy to forgot where you park sometimes which is why this app will be helpful.
	It will use your phone gps to store the car location and time you parked. 
	
## Feattures
	- store location of car using gps (drop pin)
	- allows u to enter information such 
		- if you either parked on the street or garage
		- which floor and parking space you parked in 
		- keeps track of how long you have parked
		- if parking has a meter and has a time limit; a timer will be added to  give u extact time left in meter
		- more features coming soon
